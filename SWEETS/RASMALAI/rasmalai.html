            Rasmalai is yet another one of my favorite sweets. This Bengali specialty is made with rasgulla (sweetened
            balls of paneer) soaked in sweetened, thickened milk that has been scented with cardamom and saffron. The
            result is a creamy, dreamy dessert that absolutely melts in your mouth. Make this soft and tasty Rasmalai
            recipe with my easy step-by-step photos.
