        <p>
            Some modern recipes suggest using dried or powdered milk instead of khoya. Gulab Jamun is often garnished
            with dry fruits like almonds and cashews to enhance flavour. The word "Gulab" is derived from the Persian
            words 'gol' meaning flower and 'ab' meaning water, referring to the rose water-scented syrup
