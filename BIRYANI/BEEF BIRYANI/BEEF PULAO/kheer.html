        <p>The Indian version of a sweet pudding is what we refer to as Kheer. It is basically a milk-based dessert,
            which has other ingredients, sweetener and flavorings added to it. The most classic version of this dessert
            is the rich Rice Kheer, where you slow-cook rice grains, whole milk and sugar to perfection. Addition of
            saffron, nuts, cardamom, etc. is quite subjective when it comes to this typical Kheer Recipe. This
            particular creamy version is my familyâ€™s heirloom recipe which you will love for its deliciousness. </p>
